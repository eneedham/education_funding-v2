# PA Fair Funding Formula Interactive Map

An interactive map which shows how each of Pennsylvania's 500 school districts' funding allocation from the state will change based on the new fair funding formula. As of the time of the making of this map, only 5.98% of the state's allocated funds are re-routed to school districts based on the fair funding formula. This map allows viewers to see the shifts in funding based on different percentages of state funds being run through the formula. 

This map was created with WHYY for [Keystone Crossroads](https://whyy.org/programs/keystone-crossroads/), a collaboration between PA public media organizations to report on topics that impact the state. It was published in October of 2016 in an article titled [*How would your school district fare if lawmakers ramped up the new Pa. funding formula?*](https://whyy.org/articles/how-would-your-school-district-fare-if-lawmakers-ramped-up-the-new-pa-funding-formula/).
